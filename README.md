A collection of scripts for detecting and managing IPv6 prefix
changes on the AVM Fritz!Box using wide-dhcp6.

Most German ISPs now force compulsory routers onto their customers.
Sadly, in my case, this was a shitty Fritz!Box 7360 with very
limited IPv6 support.

## Wow, this looks like a dirty hack!
Yes. It is! Nothing more.
